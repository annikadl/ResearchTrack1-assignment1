# ResearchTrack1-assignment1

Function list:
##### TODO: 
* divide brand-new functions from older ones
* provide a brief explanation of what it does
* provide a list of the parameters it takes
* provide a list of the eventual return values
* talk about global functions
* explain how to run the code
* explain how the program is expected to behaviour
* maybe insert some code blocks
* provide pseudo code or diagrams
* add comments in the code

Given functions implemented:
* `drive`: is a function that allows the robot to move in the arena. It takes two parameters _speed_ and _seconds_ that indicate how fast the robot must go and for how long.
* `turn`: is a function to set the angular velocity of the robot. As the _drive_ function takes _speed_ and _seconds_ as parameters.
`find_token`:

Brand-new functions implemented to accomplish the assignment:
* `center_group`
* `go_take_token`
* `place_first_token`
* `bring_token_to_target`
